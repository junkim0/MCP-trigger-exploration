# MCP Selection Optimization

This repository focuses on optimizing Claude's MCP (Model Context Protocol) selection behavior. The goal is to develop and test methods that make Claude consistently choose specific MCPs when given prompts.

## Project Goals

1. Research and document how Claude evaluates and selects MCPs
2. Develop methods to increase selection probability of specific MCPs
3. Create testing frameworks to measure selection consistency
