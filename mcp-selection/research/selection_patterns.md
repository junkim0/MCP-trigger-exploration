# Claude MCP Selection Patterns Research

## Overview
This document analyzes how Claude evaluates and selects MCPs when processing prompts. Understanding these patterns is crucial for optimizing MCP selection probability.

## Selection Criteria

### 1. Semantic Relevance
- Claude appears to prioritize MCPs that semantically match the user's intent
- Key factors:
  - Keyword matching
  - Context alignment
  - Task similarity
  - Domain specificity

### 2. Contextual Signals
- Strong contextual signals increase selection probability:
  - Clear task boundaries
  - Explicit tool requirements
  - Domain-specific vocabulary
  - Previous interaction patterns

### 3. Priority Mechanisms
- MCPs can implement priority levels
- Higher priority MCPs are more likely to be selected when:
  - Multiple MCPs match the intent
  - Task urgency is indicated
  - Specific expertise is required

## Selection Enhancement Methods

### 1. Intent Clarity
- Make the MCP's purpose extremely clear
- Use unambiguous trigger patterns
- Maintain consistent vocabulary
- Provide clear scope boundaries

### 2. Context Optimization
- Enhance contextual signals:
  - Strong domain markers
  - Clear task indicators
  - Explicit tool requirements
  - Well-defined success criteria

### 3. Priority Management
- Implement dynamic priority adjustment
- Use context-aware priority scaling
- Define clear priority hierarchies
- Handle priority conflicts gracefully

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Selection Rate Testing
- Measure selection probability:
  - Base rate without optimization
  - Rate with each enhancement method
  - Combined enhancement effects
  - Long-term consistency

### 2. A/B Testing
- Compare different optimization approaches:
  - Intent clarity methods
  - Context enhancement techniques
  - Priority management strategies
  - Combined approaches

### 3. Consistency Metrics
- Track selection consistency:
  - Time-based variation
  - Context variation
  - User variation
  - Task variation

## Next Steps

1. Implement tracking for selection patterns
2. Develop test cases for each hypothesis
3. Create measurement framework
4. Begin systematic testing
